  introduction1: "As the media plays a major role in people’s lives, we are curious about how media is able to sway the public's opinion on particular social issues. The goal of our project is to bring awareness to bias in written text and look at its effects on society. Our project aims to quantify social biases in media with a focus on the social subjects of race, abortion, immigration and socioeconomic classes. We will measure the effects that bias tags have on society by looking at the election outcomes of Presidential, Senate and House of Representatives candidates of every two year election cycle starting from 2016 to 2020. We define bias to represent average sentiment analysis scores where if a strongly negative body of text contains a bias term then the term’s average sentiment analysis score will be close to -1, if the the body of text is strongly positive with a bias term then the term’s score will be close to 1, and if the body of text is found to be neutral with a bias term then the term’s score will be close to 0. We assume that sentiment scores are capable of accurately representing whether people are in support of a bias term or are in opposition to it, this in turn should dictate how populations of people vote. It is for this reason we purposely selected words that would generally be deemed as controversial in today’s political climate. We also do not assume that media only necessarily mimics public opinion, but rather also possibly helps shape beliefs, it is for this reason we will be comparing sentiment scores for the different bias terms between news network articles and Twitter posts to determine how aligned public opinion appears to be on particular topics as compared to major media outlets.",
  introduction2: "Our objective is to (1) use Python’s BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries to scrape and analyze media content, (2) Use average sentiment scores from pre-built sentiment analysis model to quantify bias and compare the scores between the article dataset and Twitter dataset to see whether media opinion on social issue align with the public opinion. (3) And then we will link the Twitter data with the election data by creating a linear regression model, where the average sentiment score for the four bias terms are the covariates and the vote count will be the response of the model. The model will examine the correlation between the sentiment scores and the election outcome as well as the strength of the correlation. (4) Lastly, at the end of the report, we will also include a time series analysis between sentiment scores and election outcomes.",
  dataset1: "For the article dataset, we obtained the data by scraping from four news media sources: CBS, CNN, FoxNews, and NPR. We used the BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries in python to scrape the articles and obtain data spanning from 2012 to 2020. We wanted to obtain data dated back to 2000, because this will give us more data points when performing time series analysis. However, for many news media sites, the farthest back they can go is 2016. Because of this limitation, we decided to do a two-year election interval instead of four-year, because if we are doing a four-year election interval, we don’t have that much data to support our analysis. In addition to the time period we are collecting data from, we also choose the four media sources carefully. The four sources of media are balanced between conservative and liberal, so we can get a wide variety of information without having too much opinion leaning on one side."
